# Frequently Asked Questions (F&Q)
Why doesn't Rapper auto-update and download the latest files? Why does it have hard-coded links to the packages?
> This is simply to ease on me as a whole. I'm currently still doing work in real-life and have no time to update this program constantly. I do try to keep things up-to-date but since most programs on the package manager are already auto-updating when installing if you for example: Download an older version of a program, it will eventually auto-update or even ask you to update. I might be a developer but I'm not the best. If you would like you can take Rapper and make a better version if you have way more knowledge than me which I highly do not doubt you do.

Why is Rapper freezing when installing?
> Rapper sometimes freezes during an install when it's processing or downloading files and opening the setup. Wait a few minutes and it should automatically resolve itself and un-freeze.

Rapper is so useless! Why can't you do this or that!
> I'm a single developer. I currently have work that I must do. I can't always be online and updating Rapper. End of story.

Rapper should do this instead of that!
> If I deem a fix necessary or helpful to the development of Rapper I will fix it as soon as possible. For now if you would like to change up Rapper you can freely do so by taking the original program and making your changes then compiling a new version of Rapper.

Why is Rapper using .NET Framework 4 instead of the latest framework?
> ReactOS doesn't play nicely with the latest frameworks from my testing. .NET Framework 4 seems to play nicely and not hard to get. All-in-all it's for better and not for worse. If I could use the latest .NET Framework I would happily update Rapper and switch frameworks.
